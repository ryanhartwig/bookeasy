This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Spin up the grafbase server: 

```bash
npx grafbase dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important

No data will show unless the grafbase server is running. This project currently has no mutations implemented, therefore it is read-only.

Grafbase is only recently released and there may be some issues getting started / working properly.
